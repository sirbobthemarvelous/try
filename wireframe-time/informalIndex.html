        Last year, Cats made the leap from stage to film, and now, the Jellicle journey continues in radio-form. PodCats, a new podcast about Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical, is now available on most streaming services.

Co-hosted by Dan Alexander and EJ Dickson, the series explores suc topics as how Cats got made on Broadway in the ‘80s, what Anne Hathaway might have done with the role of Grizabella, and, of course, Digital Fur Technology.

        “We need to let children know that they belong in this world,” she says. “You can’t wait to tell them that until after they grow up or the damage will be done. 
          You have to tell them while they’re still children that they deserve love and that they deserve support and that people will be excited to hear their story. 
          When you don’t show any children stories about LGBTQIA characters and then they grow up, they’re not going to tell their own stories because they’re gonna 
          think that they’re inappropriate and they’re going to have a very good reason to think that because they’ve been told that through their entire childhood.”
